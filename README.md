# Crack_Detection_and_Classification_in_Images
This MATLAB program detects and classifies cracks in images by processing grayscale versions of the input. It identifies cracks based on pixel intensity, edge detection, and area thresholds. Each crack is analyzed for size, orientation, and risk level, with visual labeling on the image. The program aids in structural damage assessment.
